# Solo Poker

## Concept and Rules Outline

The PLAYER opens the app to a fresh game.

They can READ THE RULES by clicking the "HELP" chip, or they can START PLAYING by clicking on the deck.

## READ THE RULES

A modal view will open with two tabs; one to read the rules (as outlined below under START PLAYING) and another to view the POKER GLOSSARY. The game can be returned to at any time by closing this view.

## POKER GLOSSARY
	
A dictionary of poker terminology to aid unfamiliar players, and a visual guide to the various hands.


## START PLAYING

Upon starting the game, the DECK is shuffled, five face-down COMMUNITY CARDS will be placed on the table, and two face-up HOLE CARDS will be dealt to the PLAYER.

The game will progress through 7 stages: 
-ANTE
-FLOP REVEAL
-FLOP BETTING
-TURN REVEAL
-TURN BETTING
-RIVER REVEAL
-PAYOUTS

At the ANTE stage, the PLAYER chooses their HAND BET -- a poker hand they predict will appear during the round among the combined COMMUNITY and HOLE CARDS.

The ROUND END condition is met as soon as the HAND BET is fulfilled; the round will end and skip immediately to PAYOUTS at such a time.

### Stage 1: ANTE

The PLAYER is prompted to select an initial bet of CHIPS to place, as well as a HAND BET which they predict will be revealed by the RIVER REVEAL stage.

ROUND END if the PLAYER already has ONE PAIR as their HOLE CARDS and places their HAND BET on ONE PAIR.
- need to determine how likely this is to happen and adjust the one payout accordingly under this specific condition


### Stage 2: FLOP REVEAL

The FLOP, or initial trio of COMMUNITY CARDS, is revealed.

ROUND END if the HAND BET is fulfilled at this stage.


### Stage 3: FLOP BETTING

If the PLAYER's HAND BET has not been met by this stage, the PLAYER is given the opportunity to RAISE their bet, CHECK and proceed without changing, or FOLD to forfeit their CHIPS and trigger the ROUND END.


### Stage 4: TURN REVEAL

The TURN, or fourth COMMUNITY CARD, is revealed.

ROUND END if the HAND BET is fulfilled at this stage.


### Stage 5: TURN BETTING

As with FLOP BETTING.


### Stage 6: RIVER REVEAL

The RIVER, or fifth and final COMMUNITY CARD, is revealed.

The ROUND END occurs at this stage regardless of whether the HAND BET was fulfilled.

### Stage 7: PAYOUTS

A modal view opens with a summary of the round.

If the HAND BET was fulfilled, the PLAYER is congratulated and presented with a breakdown of their winning statistics, i.e.:
-HAND BET
-Wager Placed (in CHIPS)
-HAND BET Payout Rate (1:X)
-CHIPS Won
-Updated PLAYER CHIPS Count
-Winning Streak Count
-Any UNLOCKS earned by the PLAYER during that round


## UNLOCKS

Through various means, PLAYERs can acquire UNLOCKS which will alter the game experience. These range from cosmetic changes, like new table backdrops and card backs, to new mechanics such as the addition of JOKERS to the deck.

Some of these will be available to purchase with won CHIPS via the GIFT SHOP, but some will require some rare criteria to be fulfilled. Example: A unique Wild West-themed card set might be unlocked by winning a TWO PAIR HAND BET specificially with a black Aces and Eights (Or possibly with any of the claimants for the title of Dead Man's Hand).

### MECHANICAL UNLOCKS

-JOKERS
An unlock with two ranks.

Rank 1 unlocks MONO, a monochromatic Pierrot or Pagliaccio-type. Once unlocked, this card has a chance to appear like any other card, but will only take effect during the RIVER REVEAL stage: if the PLAYER is only one card from fulfilling their HAND BET at this final stage, MONO will automatically assume the value of that card to secure the win.

Rank 2 unlocks CHROMA, a vibrant harlequin. Once unlocked, it can appear like MONO, but [1. Can instead be manually set to any value at any stage, only once per round (could potentially be gamed for a better payoff if it appears during the ante or flop) / 2. Will take effect as soon as it would benefit the PLAYER instead of at the very end]


-NUDGE
An unlock with 3(?) ranks, each allowing an additional use per round. (Once a card has been altered, can only alter that card?)

Allows the PLAYER to raise or lower any one card's value by a single increment, e.g. bump a 10 up to a Jack or lower it to a 9.


-TAILOR
An unlock with two ranks.

Allows the PLAYER to make alterations to their suits (ehehehe).

Rank 1 allows the PLAYER the chance to change one card's suit (per round) to the other suit of the same colour (e.g. swap a King of Hearts to a King of Diamonds).

Rank 2 allows the PLAYER to change one card's suit (per round) to a corresponding suit of the opposite colour (e.g. swap a Queen of Diamonds to a Queen of Clubs).


-"WIZZERDS: THE CONGRESS" BOOSTER PACK
An unlock with one rank.

At the start of any round, adds a small chance for one card in the deck to be replaced with a card from an entirely different, financially extortionate collectible card game. Effects TBD.
